            <h2>History of Czech Republic</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>The history of the Czech Republic spans from ancient Celtic settlements and Slavic migrations to the
                formation of the Great Moravian Empire and the Kingdom of Bohemia. After centuries under Habsburg rule,
                the Czechs and Slovaks united to form Czechoslovakia in 1918. The country experienced German occupation,
                communist rule, and the Velvet Revolution, culminating in the peaceful dissolution of Czechoslovakia
                into the independent Czech Republic and Slovakia on January 1, 1993. </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Early history</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Celts and Slavs: The area was first populated by Celts, with the Boii tribe giving Bohemia its name.
                Later, Slavic tribes settled in the region, and the first attempt to unite them was Samo's kingdom in
                the 7th century.
                Great Moravia and the Kingdom of Bohemia: The Great Moravian Empire rose in the 9th century, followed by
                the prominent Kingdom of Bohemia in the 10th century.
                Habsburg Rule: In the 16th century, Bohemia came under the rule of the Habsburg monarchy, which lasted
                for centuries. </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>20th Century</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Czechoslovakia (1918): Following World War I and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire,
                Czechoslovakia was formed by uniting Czech and Slovak lands.
                Munich Agreement and Nazi occupation: Due to the rise of Nazism, Czechoslovakia was forced to cede
                border territories in the Munich Agreement of 1938. The rest of the country was occupied by Germany in
                1939.
                Post-WWII and Communism: After being liberated in 1945, Czechoslovakia fell under communist rule until
                1989.
                Velvet Revolution (1989): A series of peaceful protests led to the end of communist rule and the
                restoration of democracy.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Modern era</h3>
            <br>
            <p>"Velvet Divorce" (1993): Czechoslovakia peacefully separated into two independent nations, the Czech
                Republic and Slovakia, on January 1, 1993.
                Democratic transition: The Czech Republic transitioned into a parliamentary democracy and market
                economy.
                International integration: The country joined the OECD in 1994, NATO in 1999, and the European Union in
                2004. </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Charles IV was Holy Roman Emperor from 1355 until his death in 1378. He was elected King of Germany (King
                of the Romans) in 1346 and became King of Bohemia (as Charles I) that same year. He was a member of the
                House of Luxembourg from his father's side and the Bohemian House of Přemyslid from his mother's side;
                he emphasized the latter due to his lifelong affinity for the Bohemian side of his inheritance, and also
                because his direct ancestors in the Přemyslid line included two saints.</p>
            <br>
            <p>He was the eldest son and heir of John of Bohemia, King of Bohemia and Count of Luxembourg, who died at
                the Battle of Crécy on 26 August 1346. His mother, Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia, was the sister of
                Wenceslaus III, King of Bohemia and Poland, the last of the male Přemyslid rulers of Bohemia. Charles
                inherited the County of Luxembourg from his father and was elected king of the Kingdom of Bohemia. On 2
                September 1347, Charles was crowned King of Bohemia.</p>
            <br>
            <p>On 11 July 1346, the prince-electors chose him as King of the Romans (rex Romanorum) in opposition to
                Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor. Charles was crowned on 26 November 1346 in Bonn. After his opponent died,
                he was re-elected in 1349 and crowned King of the Romans. In 1355, he was crowned King of Italy and Holy
                Roman Emperor. With his coronation as King of Burgundy at Arles in 1365, he became the crowned ruler of
                all the kingdoms of the Holy Roman Empire. Having played a key part in the political and cultural
                history of the Kingdom of Bohemia, he remains a popular historical figure in the Czech Republic.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Golden Bull of 1356 marked a structural change in the politics of the Holy Roman Empire. Several
                aspects of his legacy remain a contentious matter though. The image of Charles as a wise, pious,
                peace-loving king (partly constructed by Charles himself) has proved influential until this day,
                supported by several artistic or scholarly projects produced during Charles's reign or afterwards. </p>
